            <h2>Providence High School JCL</h2>
            <hr class="divider">
            <p>I was in charge of designing my school's Junior Classical League (Latin Honor Society)'s website. <a href="http://andykamath.com/phsjcl" style="color:#FF0000">This</a> is what I made for them</p>

            <h2>Blue Charlotte</h2>
            <hr class="divider">
            <p>My business associate and I found a website for an uptown restaurant that had a rather outdated design, so we took it upon ourselves to design it, found at <a href="http://andykamath.com/BlueWebsite" style="color:#F00">this</a> link. Blue Restaurant is owned by its respective owners and its original website can be found <a href="http://bluecharlotte.com" style="color:#F00">here</a></p>

            <h2>Engrouped</h2>
            <hr class="divider">
            <p>I utilized a MEAN stack with Socket.IO to create a chat that people can use that deletes records on a refresh of the page. Kind of like Snapchat chatting on the internet.<a href="http://engrouped.com">Check it out!</a></p>
