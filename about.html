            <p>I'm a junior in High School that consistently scores in the >97th percentile on every standardized test I take. I'm based in Charlotte, North Carolina and love anything that involves thinking analytically. I have a passion for ancient linguistics as well - I have studied and attained proficiency in Classical Latin and Attic Greek (I am the Vice President for the state of North Carolina's Junior Classical League). I also study Sanskrit and just overall love the feel of learning a language through which I can understand the thoughts of the greatest literary minds this world has known. </p>

            <h2>STEM</h2>
            <hr class="divider">
            <p>I code mainly front-end and back-end web applications and websites, which extends into mobile application development through Cordova/Phonegap. In the past I have used PHP frameworks or a MEAN stack the majority of the time, but I am also fluent with Python-integrated environments for desktop as well as web applications using Flask. For desktop applications, I have used and am pretty decent with languages that the .NET framework encompasses (C#, F#, and VB.NET).</p>
